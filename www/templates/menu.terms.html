                <p>
                    The access to, and use of, the Website and the Application is free of charge. In order to be able to provide you with the services we offer (which may include ordering a taxi or other services) by using the Site and/or the App you must provide ESERVISS with your location information, mobile number and credit/debit card data. ESERVISS uses these details in accordance with its Privacy Policy. As part of the booking process for every trip you book, or when you order any other services, using the Website and/or the Application, you agree to allow ESERVISS to make a pre-authorization payment of $1.00 (“Pre-Authorization Payment”), on your registered credit/debit card. This amount will not be debited from your account at the time of booking but is ring-fenced for ESERVISS. If, after using ESERVISS’s services, full payment is not successfully made by you for the services, the Pre-Authorization Payment may be used to settle or as part payment towards the outstanding amount with ESERVISS. Please note that your access to the Application may be blocked or suspended at ESERVISS’s sole option until the full outstanding amount is settled. ESERVISS reserves the right to permanently close down your account if you regularly fail to make payment or if ESERVISS reasonably deems any amount outstanding is significant. In the event that, after booking, no services are provided by ESERVISS (for example, if your order for the services is cancelled) or no monies are owed to ESERVISS on your account, the full amount of the Pre-Authorization Payment will be released by ESERVISS. ESERVISS endeavors to release this amount to you as soon as possible, but your bank may take up to 72 hours to complete any release of the Pre-Authorization Payment. Due to the nature of the services we provide, ESERVISS reserves the right to change the Pre-Authorization Payment amount and/or to introduce a fee for use of the Site and/or the App, at any time by notifying you in advance of the start of any services. The rates that apply for the transportation services by the Transportation Provider can be found through the Application. These may be modified or updated by ESERVISS from time to time. It is your own responsibility to remain informed about the current rates for the transportation services. ESERVISS shall charge you for the transportation services provided to you by the Transportation Provider on behalf of the Transportation Provider. You agree that you will pay for all transportation services you purchase from the Transportation Provider, and that ESERVISS may charge your credit card account as provided by you when registering for the Service for the transportation services (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) that may be accrued by or in connection with your account. You are responsible for the timely payment of all fees and for providing ESERVISS with a valid credit card account for payment of all fees at all times. Any payment made is non-refundable. ESERVISS may, in it’s sole discretion, give promotional codes with various features from time-to-time to any of our customers. Promotion codes are only redeemable for use on the Flywheel platform and are not transferable or redeemable for cash. Promotion codes are subject to expiration and must be used no later than ninety (90) days from the date of promotion code grant or no later than the date indicated in the promotion code. ESERVISS uses a third-party payment processor (the "Payment Processor") to link your credit card account to the Application and Service. The processing of payments or credits, as applicable, in connection with your use of the Application and Service will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor and your credit card issuer in addition to these Terms. ESERVISS is not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor. In connection with your use of the Services, ESERVISS will obtain certain transaction details, which ESERVISS will use solely in accordance with its Privacy and Cookie Notice.
